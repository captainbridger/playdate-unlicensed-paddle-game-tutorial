## Unlicensed Paddle Game: A Playdate Tutorial by Mostly Bits

In this repo you'll find a tutorial for building your first [Playdate](https://play.date/) game. In it we make a game that is completely legally distinct from Atari's Pongâ„¢ that we call Unlicensed Paddle Game (please don't sue us.)

1. [tutorial/index.md](tutorial/index.md) is the tutorial
2. [source/main.lua](source/main.lua) is the complete final code
3. [build.sh](build.sh) is a small build script that will build the code in main.lua and launch the Playdate simulator. Note that it requires the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/).

Here's a quick video of the final product (unmute for sound):

Note that this tutorial is aimed at folks with at least a bit of programming experience. Familiarity with object-oriented programming in a language like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. is also helpful. If you are looking for something that involves a bit less programming, you might check out [this tutorial](https://devforum.play.date/t/pulp-pong-dev-tutorial/2315/1) for making Pong in the Playdate Pulp game editor.

Though we're not new to game development, we _are_ new to Lua and to developing for the Playdate. If you spot something that doesn't make sense or that we've gotten wrong, feel free to submit an issue or start a discussion here.

### About
[Mostly Bits](https://mostlybits.co/) is Kyle Shipley and Tony Dewan. We made an iOS word game in 2021 called [Tiler More](http://tilermore.com/) that Kyle's mom loved and our friend Tyler hated. We're really excited to make games for [Playdate](https://play.date/) and have started experimenting! This tutorial is based on what we've learned so far while making game prototypes.
