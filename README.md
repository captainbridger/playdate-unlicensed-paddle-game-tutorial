## Setup

By the end:
- Playdate SDK installed (delegating to someone else's instructions here)
- Simple build script
- main.lua file with empty update function and basic imports


## Drawing the ball

Now that you can see a blank screen in the simulator, let's make things a bit more interesting with our first sprite. We'll start with the ball.

As I mentioned in the intro, we're going to lean into the basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts offered by the Playdate SDK. These aren't strictly necessary and may have performance implications for larger games, but I find that they make code easier to reason about and extend.

Let's go ahead and make a simple `Ball` class in `main.lua` above the `playdate.update` function:

```lua
-- register a new global Lua class that inherits from sprite,
-- which will allow it to move, collide with other sprites, etc
class("Ball").extends(playdate.graphics.sprite)

-- initializer function that gets called when a
-- new instance of Ball is created
function Ball:init()
  -- since we inherit from sprite, do any sprite-related initialization
  Ball.super.init(self)

  print("I am a ball")
end

ball = Ball()

function playdate.update()
end
```

Run the build script. You should still see a blank screen, but if you open the console, you'll see "I am a ball" as expected.

<!-- SCREENSHOT HERE -->

This isn't very interesting yet - let's actually draw the ball. We'll make our ball a circle, so we need to draw a circle onto the screen and make sure it gets connected up to our sprite correctly.

There are a couple ways we could go about this:

1. Add a `draw` callback to the sprite that draws a circle on every call
2. Draw the circle into an image, then set that image on the sprite

(1) is a little simpler, but we could end up with unnecessary redraw calls in a more complex game. We're going to go down route (2) for this tutorial.

>NOTE: I am not an expert on Playdate performance yet. I borrowed this idea from [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OCebUVKlb4) recommended in the Playdate SDK docs. Please let me know if this is a very bad decision for some reason. :)

Let's add the code into our `init()` function for drawing the sprite image:

```lua {4-16}
function Ball:init()
  Ball.super.init(self)

  radius = 5
  -- create a new image placeholder that is big enough for the circle's diameter
  local ballImage = playdate.graphics.image.new(2 * radius, 2 * radius)
  -- create a fresh drawing context, just in case other transformations are active
  playdate.graphics.pushContext(ballImage)
  playdate.graphics.fillCircleAtPoint(radius, radius, radius)
  -- reset the drawing context so we don't pollute other calls
  playdate.graphics.popContext()
  -- set the sprite's image to be the circle image we just drew
  self:setImage(ballImage)

  -- move it to the center of the screen so we can see it
  self:moveTo(200, 120)
end
```

We need to do a couple small housekeeping items before the ball will render:

```lua {2,5}
ball = Ball()
ball:add()

function playdate:update()
  playdate.graphics.sprite.update()
end
```

If you re-run the build script, you should now see a ball drawn near the center of the screen. üéâ

A couple things to note before we get too far:

1. In most graphics programming, `(0,0)` represents the top-left of the screen. So drawing our ball at `(200, 120)` means "draw 200 pixels from the left, 120 pixels from the top."

2. We defined `ballImage` as a `local` variable. Variables in Lua are global by default, which makes them accessible across all files in a project. This can be handy in some cases - for example, maybe our paddle AI will want to take the ball's position into account. But there are usually better ways to organize code without using globals. I won't cover that in-depth in this tutorial, but might do a follow-up around using events to decouple components.

   In this case, we don't want to define `ballImage` as a global since nothing outside the sprite constructor should need to access it, so we define it as `local` to limit its scope.

## Tidying up

I don't know about you, but I get tired of typing `playdate.graphics` over and over. Let's create a shortcut since we're going to be using that a lot:

```lua {1,3,9-12,22}
gfx = playdate.graphics

class("Ball").extends(gfx.sprite)

function Ball:init()
  Ball.super.init(self)

  radius = 5
  local ballImage = gfx.image.new(2 * radius, 2 * radius)
  gfx.pushContext(ballImage)
  gfx.fillCircleAtPoint(radius, radius, radius)
  gfx.popContext()
  self:setImage(ballImage)

  self:moveTo(200, 120)
end

ball = Ball()
ball:add()

function playdate.update()
  gfx.sprite.update()
end
```

Normally I'm a fan of expressive variable names, but `gfx` is such a core concept here that I'm okay abbreviating it.

## Making the ball move

When table tennis was invented in 1847, players just sat the ball perfectly still in the middle of the table. If the ball rolled off your side of the table, it exposed your low moral character and you were summarily executed.

A few years later, they decided to add a rule where you were allowed to hit the ball back and forth. It was so much fun they forgot all about the executions.

Let's make our ball move before we get executed.

To start, we'll have it move right forever. Any sprite that has been registered with `add()` will have its `update()` method called by `gfx.sprite.update()`. So let's add an `update()` function to our `Ball` class:

```lua {1-4}
function Ball:update()
  -- move 1 pixel right, 0 pixels down
  self:moveBy(1, 0)
end
```

Rebuild the game and you should see your ball slowly slide off the right side of your screen into oblivion.

We don't have a great way to make the ball turn around yet. We want to have it move right until it gets to the edge, then turn around and go left until it gets to the edge, and so on. We need more than just the ball's position to make this happen - we also need its speed.

Let's change our `init()` function to store an `xSpeed`, then use that value to move the ball:

```lua {4,10}
function Ball:init()
  Ball.super.init(self)

  self.xSpeed = 1

  -- etc
end

function Ball:update()
  self:moveBy(self.xSpeed, 0)
end
```

Rebuild the game again and your ball should still be drifting off into space. Try changing to `self.xSpeed = 5` and watch it drift more quickly. Cool.

Now that we have a speed, we can make the ball turn around when it gets to the edge and go the other direction. Let's try it:

```lua {5,12-16}
function Ball:init()
  Ball.super.init(self)

  -- 1 is too slow :)
  self.xSpeed = 5

  -- etc
end

function Ball:update()
  -- screen width = 400
  if self.x + self.xSpeed >= 400 then
    self.xSpeed *= -1
  elseif self.x + self.xSpeed <= 0 then
    self.xSpeed *= -1
  end

  self:moveBy(self.xSpeed, 0)
end
```

Rebuild the game. You should see the ball moving back and forth between the right and left edges of the screen.
