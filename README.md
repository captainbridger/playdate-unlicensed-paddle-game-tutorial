## Unlicensed Paddle Game: A Playdate Tutorial by Mostly Bits

In this repo you'll find a tutorial for building your first [Playdate](https://play.date/) game. In it we make a game that is completely legally distinct from Atari's Pongâ„¢ that we call Unlicensed Paddle Game (please don't sue us.)

1. [tutorial/index.md](tutorial/index.md) is the tutorial
2. [source/main.lua](source/main.lua) is the complete final code
3. [build.sh](build.sh) is a small build script that will build the code in main.lua and launch the Playdate simulator. Note that it requires the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/).

Note that this tutorial is aimed at folks with at least a bit of programming experience. Familiarity with object-oriented programming in a language like C#, Java, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. is also helpful. If you are looking for something that involves a bit less programming, you might check out [this tutorial](https://devforum.play.date/t/pulp-pong-dev-tutorial/2315/1) for making Pong in the Playdate Pulp game editor.

Though we're not new to game development, we *are* new to Lua and to developing for the Playdate. If you spot something that doesn't make sense or that we've gotten wrong, you can submit an issue here or [message us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mostlybits) and we'll get right on it. Your feedback is welcome and appreciated!

### About
[Mostly Bits](https://mostlybits.co/) is Kyle Shipley and Tony Dewan. We made an iOS word game in 2021 called [Tiler More](http://tilermore.com/) that Kyle's mom loved and our friend Tyler hated. We're really excited to make games for [Playdate](https://play.date/) and have started experimenting! This tutorial is based on what we've learned so far while making game prototypes.
